    <p>The group meets every Wednesday(1st session: September 7) from 2.30pm to 4.30pm at the Stadtteiltreff Höttinger Au. The
    aims of the group are simple:</p>
    
    <li>to offer a wide range of toys, puzzles, books, sensory tunnels, songs etc to kids aged 0-6, whilst giving children the
    opportunity to interact and form new friendships in English.</li>
    <li>to be supportive to Mummies, Daddies and Grandparents. The opportunity to speak to another adult(yay!) - and a chance to
    have a cup of coffee(donation based).</li>
    <li>to embrace Circle Time and celebrate Anglophone festivals like Halloween, St Patrick’s Day, Holi etc</li>
    <p>Note: While this group was originally created for families where English is one of the home languages, you don’t need to
    be English speakers to attend. Everyone is welcome.</p>
